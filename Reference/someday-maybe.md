# Someday / Maybe

A parking lot for genuinely open ideas/tasks that aren’t active right now.

## Griddle (archived 2026-02-20)
- Remember drag-bar/page split width between sessions
- Fast entry: styling when notes are present
- Bug: font-only styling showing as none does not render text
- Hide blank row from dummy dates
- Settings: allow changing date format and data format overall
- Collect and synthesize Griddle feedback from employee testing (when employees submit feedback)

## Linux ricing — Montblanc (FFT) (archived 2026-02-20)
- Set Montblanc avatar (Discord/OpenClaw)
- Set terminal colors in Ptyxis to match palette
- Optional: tmux theme to match
