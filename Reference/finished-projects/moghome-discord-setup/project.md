# Project: Moghome — Discord server setup (admin + structure)

- **Created:** 2026-02-06
- **Status:** Active
- **Outcome (what done looks like):**
  - Montblanc bot has full admin permissions in the Discord server
  - Server structure supports our work (GTD, project-first work threads, notes)
  - Clear conventions: where capture happens, where weekly review happens, where decisions/logs live

## TODO

### NEXT ACTION

### WAITING
- [ ] #waitingfor #project/moghome-discord-setup Set Montblanc bot avatar — use `Reference/avatars/montblanc-avatar-zoom-1024.png` (manual: Discord Developer Portal → Bot → Avatar)
- [ ] #waitingfor #project/moghome-discord-setup Set server/channel icon for Moghome (manual)

### DONE
- [x] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Verify bot has Administrator permission (confirmed via permissions check)
- [x] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Write Moghome design doc: goals, categories/channels, naming conventions, and “how we work here” pins
- [x] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Get Matt notes/approval on the design doc (notes incorporated)
- [x] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Implement the layout (create categories/channels) and pin “how we work here” messages
- [x] #waitingfor #project/moghome-discord-setup You: assign the bot an Admin role (done)

## Someday / Maybe
- [ ] #someday #project/moghome-discord-setup Add a private "scratch" channel for quick dumps and cleanup
- [ ] #someday #project/moghome-discord-setup Add an "automation" channel for cron/job error reports

## Notes / Context
- Tools: I can create/edit/delete categories/channels once the bot has permissions.
- Since it’s just us, full admin is acceptable; we can downgrade later if desired.
