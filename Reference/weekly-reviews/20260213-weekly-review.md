# Weekly Review - 20260213

## Get Clear
- [x] Close open loops (anything on your mind) into Inbox (captured TBH Month End project)
- [x] Clear Inbox (goal: Inbox only contains **open** tasks)
  - [x] Move/convert items into Projects as needed
  - [x] Copy checked-off Inbox items into this doc under "Completed Items"
  - [x] Delete checked-off items from Inbox
- [x] Create any new project hubs needed (consolidated structured-json-editor into griddle, created TBH Month End Procedures)
- [x] Archive any completed projects (none to archive — all active)

## Generate Weekly Tasks (recurring)
> Create any tasks that should happen every week and put them in Inbox (or directly in a project hub).
- [x] Review the previous weekly review and copy forward any still-relevant recurring tasks (none identified)
- [x] Add this week's recurring tasks to Inbox (leave unchecked) (none — employee feedback will drive Griddle work)

## Get Current
- [x] Mark done / delete / clarify any todos (scanned Inbox + all active project hubs)
- [x] Ensure every active project has at least one Next Action (Griddle: awaiting feedback; Linux Ricing: 3 waitingfor; Moghome: avatar tasks; TBH Month End: 5 next actions)
- [x] Review Next Actions (3 focus items set for next week)
- [x] Review Waiting For (4 items: avatar x2, terminal colors, tmux theme, TBH Python overview)
- [x] Review Someday / Maybe (all projects have someday items captured)

## Get Focused
- [x] Add a #focus tag to 3 items that are tagged #nextaction
- [x] List those focused actions here:
  - [x] #focus Collect and synthesize Griddle feedback from employee testing (next week)
  - [x] #focus Plan TBH Month End procedures project (tax workflow + process docs)
  - [x] #focus Design undo/redo system for Griddle (prep for post-feedback implementation)
- [x] Note whether last week's focused actions were completed

**Last Week's Focus (20260206):**
- [ ] #focus Set Montblanc avatar everywhere — **NOT COMPLETED** (moved to waitingfor)
- [ ] #focus Set Ptyxis terminal colors — **NOT COMPLETED** (moved to waitingfor)
- [ ] #focus tmux theme — **NOT COMPLETED** (moved to waitingfor)

*All 3 items still waiting on Matt; no blockers on my end*

## Maintenance (meta)
- [x] Review this weekly review and update durable context as needed:
  - [x] SOUL.md (behavior/style rules) — reviewed, no changes needed
  - [x] HEARTBEAT.md (what to check proactively) — reviewed, no changes needed
  - [x] USER.md (preferences, ongoing work) — reviewed, no changes needed
  - [x] MEMORY.md / daily memory files (distill what matters) — updated Griddle status + added TBH project
- [x] Quick sanity check: GitHub sync job is running and repo reflects changes — **FIXED** (SSH auth working, pushed latest commits)

## Completed Items
> Paste/copy completed items from Inbox (and/or projects) here as your weekly record.
