# Weekly Review - 20260213

## Get Clear
- [ ] Close open loops (anything on your mind) into Inbox
- [x] Clear Inbox (goal: Inbox only contains **open** tasks)
  - [x] Move/convert items into Projects as needed
  - [x] Copy checked-off Inbox items into this doc under "Completed Items"
  - [x] Delete checked-off items from Inbox
- [x] Create any new project hubs needed (none — consolidated structured-json-editor into griddle)
- [ ] Archive any completed projects (move project folder → Reference/finished-projects)

## Generate Weekly Tasks (recurring)
> Create any tasks that should happen every week and put them in Inbox (or directly in a project hub).
- [ ] Review the previous weekly review and copy forward any still-relevant recurring tasks
- [ ] Add this week's recurring tasks to Inbox (leave unchecked)
  - [ ] <weekly task 1>
  - [ ] <weekly task 2>
  - [ ] <weekly task 3>

## Get Current
- [ ] Mark done / delete / clarify any todos (scan Inbox + active project hubs)
- [ ] Ensure every active project has at least one Next Action
- [ ] Review Next Actions
- [ ] Review Waiting For
- [ ] Review Someday / Maybe

## Get Focused
- [x] Add a #focus tag to 3 items that are tagged #nextaction
- [x] List those focused actions here:
  - [x] #focus Collect and synthesize Griddle feedback from employee testing (next week)
  - [x] #focus Plan TBH Month End procedures project (tax workflow + process docs)
  - [x] #focus Design undo/redo system for Griddle (prep for post-feedback implementation)
- [ ] Note whether last week's focused actions were completed

## Maintenance (meta)
- [ ] Review this weekly review and update durable context as needed:
  - [ ] SOUL.md (behavior/style rules)
  - [ ] HEARTBEAT.md (what to check proactively)
  - [ ] USER.md (preferences, ongoing work)
  - [ ] MEMORY.md / daily memory files (distill what matters)
- [x] Quick sanity check: GitHub sync job is running and repo reflects changes — **FIXED** (SSH auth working, pushed latest commits)

## Completed Items
> Paste/copy completed items from Inbox (and/or projects) here as your weekly record.
