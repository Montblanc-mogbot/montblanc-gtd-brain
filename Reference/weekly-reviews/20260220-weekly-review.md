# Weekly Review — 20260220

## Get Clear
- [x] Close open loops (anything on your mind) into Inbox
- [x] Clear Inbox (goal: Inbox only contains **open** tasks)
  - [x] Move/convert items into Projects as needed
  - [x] Copy checked-off Inbox items into this doc under “Completed Items”
  - [x] Delete checked-off items from Inbox
- [x] Create any new project hubs needed (none)
- [x] Archive any completed projects (move project folder → Reference/finished-projects)
  - Archived: Griddle; Linux ricing — Montblanc (FFT)

## Generate Weekly Tasks (recurring)
> Create any tasks that should happen every week and put them in Inbox (or directly in a project hub).
- [x] Review the previous weekly review and copy forward any still-relevant recurring tasks (none identified)
- [x] Add this week’s recurring tasks to Inbox (leave unchecked) (none added this week)

## Get Current
- [x] Mark done / delete / clarify any todos (scan Inbox + active project hubs)
- [x] Ensure every active project has at least one Next Action
- [x] Review Next Actions
- [x] Review Waiting For
- [x] Review Someday / Maybe

## Get Focused
- [x] Pick 3 focus items for the week (can be #nextaction or key unblocks)
- [x] List those focused actions here:
  - [ ] #focus (UNBLOCK) tbh-report-catalog: Sample data from `plnt` + core dispatch tables (TICK/TKTL/TKTC/ORDR/ORDL)
  - [ ] #focus (UNBLOCK) tbh-report-catalog: GL schema (table names/shape for expenses)
  - [ ] #focus (UNBLOCK) tbh-month-end-procedures: Python scripts overview (structure only, no credentials)
- [x] Note whether last week’s focused actions were completed: **1/3 completed** (undo/redo design done; month-end planning + Griddle feedback still blocked)

## Maintenance (meta)
- [x] Review this weekly review and update durable context as needed:
  - [x] SOUL.md (behavior/style rules)
  - [x] HEARTBEAT.md (what to check proactively)
  - [x] USER.md (preferences, ongoing work)
  - [x] MEMORY.md / daily memory files (distill what matters)
- [x] Quick sanity check: GitHub sync job is running and repo reflects changes

> Paste/copy completed items from Inbox (and/or projects) here as your weekly record.
