# Organization system rules (working)

## Tags
- `#nextaction` — the next physical action to move something forward
- `#waitingfor` — blocked because we are waiting on an external person/input (often Matt)
- `#waitingon` — similar to waitingfor; used inside project hubs for “waiting on” lists
- `#someday` — not active now
- `#focus` — chosen during weekly review
- `#project/<slug>` — ties a todo to a project directory

## When to use #waitingfor
Use `#waitingfor` when the action cannot proceed without something from Matt (approval, files, credentials, a decision) or any external party.

## Reporting cadence
Periodically (e.g., daily or when pinged), report:
- all open `#waitingfor` items
- which project they belong to
- what the unblock requires
