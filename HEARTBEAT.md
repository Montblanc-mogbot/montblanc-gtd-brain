# Lightweight hygiene checks (keep quiet unless action needed)

- Check for new messages in active `#work` threads since last check; reply in-thread if something needs a response.
- Scan `Inbox/inbox.md` for open `#waitingfor`; if anything is waiting on Matt, post a concise unblock request in `#waiting-for`.
- If it’s Friday morning and weekly review isn’t started, post a reminder in `#weekly-review` with the GitHub link.
- If any scheduled job posts an error (e.g., GitHub sync), surface it in `#automation-log`.
