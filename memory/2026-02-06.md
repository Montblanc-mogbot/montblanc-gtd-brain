# 2026-02-06

- Implemented Obsidian vault wiring for GTD brain (dashboard + .obsidian minimal config).
- Installed Obsidian via Flatpak (md.obsidian.Obsidian).
- Set up GitHub CLI auth for bot account (device-code flow) and created/pushed repo: https://github.com/Montblanc-mogbot/montblanc-gtd-brain
- Added 30-minute GitHub sync cron job.
- Added Friday-morning weekly review generator (creates weekly review file + single Inbox task pointing at it).
- Fixed Dash to Dock: GNOME needed logout/login for extension discovery; enabled + configured after relog.
- Security/process note: passwords should not be shared via Discord; prefer device-code/token flows.
