## Completed Work

### TBH Report Catalog
- **Created comprehensive README** with:
  - Architecture diagram showing 4-layer pipeline (Extract → Normalize → Analyze → Report)
  - Design principles (one dataset per question, explainable data, reconciliation)
  - 8 proposed analytical datasets with source/question/user mapping
  - Data reconciliation framework with variance tracking template
  - Normalization rules examples (plant codes, material names, dates)
  - File structure proposal
  - Open questions for Matt to review

### TBH Report Catalog - C# Project Scaffolding
- **Created full C# solution** at `Projects/tbh-report-catalog/`:
  - `Tbh.Extract/` - Interfaces for database extraction (ICommandAlkonExtractor, record models)
  - `Tbh.Normalize/` - Data normalization logic (plant code mapping, date alignment)
  - `Tbh.Analytics/` - PlantPerformance dataset builder with aggregation logic
  - `Tbh.Reports/` - Excel generation interfaces (EPPlus-based)
  - `Tbh.ReportCatalog/` - Main orchestrator wiring all layers together
- **Key design decisions captured**:
  - `slsd` table is primary source (volume, revenue, estimated costs by plant)
  - `plnt` table for plant master data
  - Matt implements extraction interfaces (SQL queries audited separately)
  - Normalization layer handles cross-system code mapping
  - Plant Performance v1 focuses on Command data only (GL integration later)

### Schema Analysis
- Analyzed Command Alkon schema dump (200+ tables)
- Identified core tables for reporting: `slsd`, `plnt`, `tkt`, `tktd`, `itrn`, `artb`
- Confirmed `slsd` (Sales Detail) has estimated costs: `ext_matl_cost_amt`, `haul_cost_amt`, `ovhd_cost_amt`
- Clarified architecture: Command = operational reality + estimated costs, GL = financial truth

## Remaining Blockers
- Web search API still unavailable (Brave token issue)
- Griddle feedback: still awaiting employee submissions
- TBH Month End: still need Python script overview from Matt

## Pushed Changes
- Committed Report Catalog README
- Updated Inbox to mark task complete
- Created C# project skeleton with solution file and project references
