# 2026-02-09

- Configuration audit with Matt:
  - Memory search is NOT properly configured (missing from openclaw.json, no API key)
  - memory_search tool failing with "No API key found" errors
  - No vector search capability over MEMORY.md or memory/*.md currently
  - Only 2 daily notes exist (Feb 5-6), nothing recent
  - No MEMORY.md for curated long-term memory

- Cron jobs confirmed working:
  - 30-min GitHub sync: running successfully
  - Weekly review generator: scheduled Fridays 9am ET

- Proposed improvements discussed:
  1. Enable memory search (needs OpenAI API key or local embedding model)
  2. Add automatic memory capture during important conversations
  3. Enhance HEARTBEAT with daily memory review, stale task detection
  4. Create/update MEMORY.md with distilled knowledge

- SOUL.md and HEARTBEAT.md are properly configured for GTD workflow
  - GTD brain rules encoded
  - #inbox capture workflow defined
  - #work thread response rules in place
