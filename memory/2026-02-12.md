## Griddle
- Completed **Milestone 8: Filters + Views System**.
  - Added domain filter/view types: `DimensionFilter`, `FilterSet`, `View`.
  - Implemented filter application in pivot compute (`computePivot(..., activeFilterSet)` filters records before aggregation).
  - Added UI: `FilterPopup.tsx` (Excel-style dimension list + checkbox values + include/exclude + search + select all/none + apply/cancel).
  - Added UI: `ViewsDropdown.tsx` (save-as, load, update, delete views; active view id tracked).
  - Persistence: `DatasetFileV1.views?: View[]` + dataset import/export parsing for views.
  - Ribbon: Filters icon now shows badge count of active dimension filters.
  - README updated with Filters + Views usage.
  - Tests and build passing.
- Commit pushed to GitHub: `ae4cfb5` ("Milestone 8: filters + views").
