# Project: Moghome — Discord server setup (admin + structure)

- **Created:** 2026-02-06
- **Status:** Active
- **Outcome (what done looks like):**
  - Montblanc bot has full admin permissions in the Discord server
  - Server structure supports our work (GTD, accounting, programming, notes)
  - Clear conventions: where tasks go, where status updates go, where files/links go

## Next Actions
- [ ] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Verify bot has Administrator permission (role assigned) via a test channel create
- [ ] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Propose a minimal channel/category layout for our work
- [ ] #nextaction #project/moghome-discord-setup Implement the layout (create categories/channels) and pin “how we work here” messages

## Waiting On
- [ ] #waitingfor #project/moghome-discord-setup You: assign the bot an Admin role (or Administrator permission) in Server Settings → Roles

## Someday / Maybe
- [ ] #someday #project/moghome-discord-setup Add a private "scratch" channel for quick dumps and cleanup
- [ ] #someday #project/moghome-discord-setup Add an "automation" channel for cron/job error reports

## Notes / Context
- Tools: I can create/edit/delete categories/channels once the bot has permissions.
- Since it’s just us, full admin is acceptable; we can downgrade later if desired.
